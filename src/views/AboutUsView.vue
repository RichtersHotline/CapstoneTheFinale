      <h4 class="centered2">We didn’t start out as a website. After WW2. A group of veterans. Beaten and broken by the war went home not to praise but to disdain and resentment.</h4> 
      <h4 class="centered3">They met up every week with other veterans. Sending letters. Having group support meetings. Then the internet was born...</h4>

        <h2 class="text-center">Our Aim</h2>
    <p>We want a place of solace for our retired and serving veterans. A place where they can belong and not feel ostracised. We fought for this country and we’ll continue to do so. No matter what people think of us.</p>
    <h2 class="text-center">About Our Owner</h2>
    <p>Our owner, Richter Berg is a distinguished veteran. Born in Miami Florida. He was drafted at the age of 18. His story is a common one coming home to protests and disdain. He formed the group “The Home Of Broken Heroes” and once the internet was born he created this website.</p>
